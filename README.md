# Matrix-Game
A game in python where the player has to reach the goal position from the start position, collecting all the randomly spawned rewards and avoiding obstacles. 
The grid is of size n X n. n is taken as an input from the user. The start and goal positions are randomly placed on the boundary. 
The player can make moves like up, down, left and right
 A move is to be taken as input from the player. For instance, R4D3L2U1 means move 4 units to the right, then 3 units down, then 2 units to the left and finally 1 unit upwards. (The input need not necessarily contain all R, L, U and D. For example, R4D3 is also a valid input).
